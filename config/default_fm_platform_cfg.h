/**
 * @file
 *
 * This is a compatibility header for the "platform_cfg.h" file that has
 * traditionally provided both public and private config definitions
 * for each CFS app.
 *
 * These definitions are now provided in two separate files, one for
 * the public/mission scope and one for internal scope.
 *
 * @note Instead of overriding this file directly, one should override the
 * fm_mission_cfg.h and/or fm_internal_cfg.h, respectively.  This file is only
 * in the "config" directory for compatibility with historical use-cases
 * where this file was directly provided by a mission config.
